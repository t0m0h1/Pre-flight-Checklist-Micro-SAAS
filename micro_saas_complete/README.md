# ChecklistSaaS - Micro SaaS (Flask)

This is a minimal micro-SaaS built with Flask that lets users create branded checklists and export them as PDFs.

## Quick start (local)

1. Create a virtualenv and activate it.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file with `SECRET_KEY` if desired.
4. Run: `flask run` or `python app.py`

Templates are under the `templates/` folder. Uploads are stored in `uploads/`.
